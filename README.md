# Sentimental_Analysis

Classification of movie reviews into positive and negative using labeled train data in html format.Used nltk tokenizer and some stopwords for removing unwanted tokens/words.
Implemented using Logistic Regression and compared against AdaBoost & LinearREgression(used a Sentimental scoring on a scale of 1 to 5).
Logisctic Regression was on par with AdaBoost on CLassification scores around 70-75%

Future implementation: Use Vader Sentimental analysis for comparison and large datasets.Also possibility of using snorkel for labelling raw data for training.
